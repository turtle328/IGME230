## Progress Timeline
(Heavily summuarized)
1. Started with the Circle Blaster HW.
2. Fit the project into Project 1 site.
3. Worked on labels and buttons generations for all 4 screens: start, instructions, game, and defeat.
4. Worked on hearts class, flash method.
5. Worked on movers class. Hearts and the player are both movers so it was essential to get working
6. Implemented a hearts array that spawns hearts one by one using the setInterval method.
7. Added an animated sprites through TexturePacker.
8. Made a custom cursor through Photoshop.
9. Added plenty of sound effects and music through howler.js.
10. Custom coded my own fade in and fade out animation for text indicating what wave it is.
11. Played around with async to get cool timing effects with lose() method with explosions and sound effects.

## Met Requirements
All requirements should be met as there are no errors, plenty of sounds and other media, clean UI, fully validated HTML/CSS, and etc.

I feel I certainly went above and beyond with testing out async and using various tools to help me develop the game such as Photoshop for creating the cursor and TexturePacker for creating animated sprite sheets.

## Grade
I feel me and Kyle worked hard on this project and I feel it deserves an A or at least an A-. I have spent many days on this project staying up very late, and I am very proud of it! Altogether it is over 1,000 lines of code, so it was quite of bit of work, but I think it was worth it and the game is very expandable in its current state. Perhaps I'll add powerups and other types of hearts, next for a good portfolio piece :)
