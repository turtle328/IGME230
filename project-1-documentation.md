# Love is Deadly

## I. High Concept
Valentine’s themed! You must collect falling hearts that fall from the top of the screen they
will periodically “beat” a color which indicates if it’s a “good” heart, a “bad” heart, or even something else!
Touch enough bad hearts you lose or lose enough good hearts you lose.

## II. Genre
Action game with avoidance mechanics.

## III. Platform
Desktop for now, but certainly could be ported to phone.

## IV. Story
The theme is based around love and Valentine’s day as it recently happened.
You are collecting as many good hearts as you can while avoiding bad hearts.
There occasionally might be a “special” heart that can give a potential super power,
e.g. allow you to move faster. Romantic, fast-paced, faster hearts and less beats indicating
what heart type as time goes on, with a high-score feature.

## V. Esthetics
Graphics style – cartoonish probably with vector art. 

Sound – simple looped music perhaps that gets faster as you get further into the game.

## VI. Gameplay

### I. Mechanics
Dodge the bad hearts and gather the good hearts, this will require both more memory and coordination as time goes on. Who can get the highest score?

### II. Controls
- Keyboard:
  - A/D or Left arrow-key and right arrow-key to move left and right respectively
  - Spacebar or W to jump
  - E to use power
  - Esc to pause

  
### III. Onboarding
Game starts “frozen” and instructions will be displayed, which will disappear upon moving. Also instructions can be viewed in pause menu. 
 
### IV. Player Learning
Take advantage of the jump button for what hearts you know are good and try to memorize which hearts are bad. Keep track of powers and memorize which power is associated with what color, and if it’s a stored power be sure to know when to time it properly.
