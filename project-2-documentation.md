## Progress Timeline
1. Started with the Anime starter files.
2. Styled up the site with CSS.
3. Turned searchbox into a dropdown box.
4. Added sort functionality.
5. Added genre checkboxes
6. Added a toggle button to search by AND/OR.
7. Added two seperate filters for arrays depending on whether AND or OR was picked.
8. Added fluidity through media queries in CSS.
9. Added local storage functionality that stores: day, sort, and genres.
10. Polished and removed bugs.

## Met Requirements
Me and Kyle went through the rubric, item by item and made sure everything is ticked off. 

We have 4 controls: Day dropdown, Sort dropdown, a toggle button, and 17 checkboxes to pick genres from.

Other requirements met include well designed site with almost 300 lines of CSS, plenty of comments
in Javascript file and fully validated HTML/CSS.

## Contribution
I feel me and Kyle worked hard on this project and I feel it deserves an A or at least an A-.

I did a lot of HTML and CSS and functionality for the controls. Kyle did the local storage and helped me design the layout of the page and
many other big decisions.
